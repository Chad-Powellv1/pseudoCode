# **Pseudocode Project**

## Gas Fireplace 
<br> 

<p><img src = './img/fire.jpg' alt = 'Gas Fireplace' width = '150' /></p>

### **Main Goal**: The end user should be able to turn the fireplace on or off at any desired time or set the unit to operate based on a desired room temperature. The fireplace will be operated remotely with a wireless remote control.

# **Important Items**
<br>

  * If the pilot light goes out a device must be installed to automatically shut off the gas to protect the end user from harm.

 * A conversion must be built in, to the thermostat, so the unit can be used in multiple markets for Fahrenheit or Celsius temperature readings.

  * A safe high temperature setting must be set so an end user cannot accidently set the temperature above the recommended temperature setting for the fireplace specifications.
  
  * A manual igniter system to ensure the pilot light cannot be lite remotely, ensuring the fireplace has been inspected before the first use of the season.

  # **Objects**

  * **Propane / Natural Gas** -> Purchased and installed by end user.

  * **Gas line** -> From tank to fireplace purchased and installed by end user.

  * **Gas Fireplace**  

     * Fireplace insert -> Holds fireplace components.

        * Ignitor -> Ignites the fire with an electric spark.

        * Pilot light -> A unit that produces a small flame which stays lite, to help lite the main burner.

        * Thermocouple -> Measures the temperature of the pilot light, and ensures it's constant operation. If the pilot goes out the Thermocouple will send a signal to the emergency shut off valve preventing the gas from contining to flow.

        * Emergency Shut Off Valve -> Shuts off the gas supply if a signal is received from the Thermocouple.

        * Gas burner -> Location where the flames are generated by the burning gas.

        * Remote infrared/bluetooth sensor -> Used to create a wireless connection between the remote control and the gas fireplace.

        * Manual Controls
        
           * Flame Control  -> Used to control the flame volume on the fireplace burner unit. **Note**: turns left to lower flame and right to raise flame, controlling gas flow. 

             * Flame Control (Push) -> When the flame conrol knob is pushed down it provides a controlled amount of gas, which is used to ignite the pilot light. 

           *  Ignitor Button -> Used to produce an electic spark igniting the pilot lite. Must be used in conjuction with the push feature of the Flame Control (Push) feature.

 * Wireless Remote

    * Digital display -> Displays the current ambient room tempurate.

    * Thermostat -> Senses the ambient room temperaure and turns the fireplace on or off if it is set.

    * Buttons 

       * On button -> Turns the fireplace on, to the current flame setting.

       * Off button -> Turns the fireplace off.

       * Mode button -> Cycles between manual operation and thermostat mode

       * Set button -> Sets the temperature for the thermostat.

       * Batteries -> Two (2) triple (AAA) batteries provide power to the remote. **Note**: first set of batteries will be provided to end user, all replacements will be the responsibility of the end user.
