# **Pseudocode Project**

## Gas Fireplace

<p><img src = './img/fire.jpg' alt = 'Gas Fireplace' width = '150' /></p>

### **Operational Expectations**: The end user should be able to turn the fireplace on or off at any desired time or set the unit to operate based on a desired room temperature. The fireplace will be operated remotely with a wireless remote control.

# **Important Items**

<br>

- If the pilot light goes out a device must be installed to automatically shut off the gas to protect the end user from harm.

- A conversion must be built in, to the thermostat, so the unit can be used in multiple markets for Fahrenheit or Celsius temperature readings.

- A safe high temperature setting must be set so an end user cannot accidentally set the temperature above the recommended temperature setting for the fireplace specifications.

- A manual igniter system to ensure the pilot light cannot be lite remotely, ensuring the fireplace has been inspected before the first use of the season.

- **Gas Fireplace**

  - Fireplace Insert

  - Gas Burner: Location where the flames are generated by the burning gas.

    - Igniter: Ignites the fire with an electric spark.

    - Pilot light: A unit that produces a small flame which stays lite, to help lite the main burner.

    - Thermocouple: Measures the temperature of the pilot light, and ensures it's constant operation. If the pilot goes out the Thermocouple will send a signal to the emergency shut off valve preventing the gas from continuing to flow.

    - Emergency Shut Off Valve: Shuts off the gas supply if a signal is received from the Thermocouple.

    - Remote infrared/bluetooth sensor unit: Used to create a wireless connection between the remote control and the gas fireplace.

    - Decorative logs: Provides the look of a real fireplace.

    - Rock Wool: Provides the look of glowing embers

    - Manual Control Unit

      - Flame Control Knob: Used to control the flame volume on the fireplace burner unit. **Note**: turns left to lower flame and right to raise flame, controlling gas flow.

        - Flame Control (Push feature): When the flame control knob is pushed down it provides a controlled amount of gas, which is used to ignite the pilot light.

      - Igniter Button: Used to produce an electric spark igniting the pilot lite. Must be used in conjunction with the push feature of the Flame Control (Push) feature.

<br>

- Wireless Remote Control

  - Digital display: Displays the current ambient room temperature.

  - Thermostat: Senses the ambient room temperature and turns the fireplace on or off if it is set.

  - Buttons

    - On button: Turns the fireplace on, to the current flame setting.

    - Off button: Turns the fireplace off.

    - Mode button: Cycles between manual operation and thermostat mode

    - Set button: Sets the temperature for the thermostat.

    - Batteries: Two (2) triple (AAA) batteries provide power to the remote. **Note**: first set of batteries will be provided to end user, all replacements will be the responsibility of the end user.
