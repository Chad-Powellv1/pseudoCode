<p><img src = './img/fire.jpg' alt = 'Gas Fireplace' width = '150' /></p>

### **Main Goal**: The end user should be able to turn the fireplace on or off at any desired time or set the unit to operate based on a desired room temperature. The fireplace will be operated remotely with a wireless remote control.

### **Important Items**
<br>

  * If the pilot light goes out a device must be installed to automatically shut off the gas to protect the end user from harm.

 * A conversion must be built in, to the thermostat, so the unit can be used in multiple markets for Fahrenheit or Celsius temperature readings.

  * A safe high temperature setting must be set so an end user cannot accidently set the temperature above the recommended temperature setting for the fireplace specifications.
  
  * A manual igniter system to ensure the pilot light cannot be lite remotely, ensuring the fireplace has been inspected before the first use of the season.

  ## **Objects**

  * **Propane / Natural Gas** -> Purchased and installed by end user.

  * **Gas line** -> From tank to fireplace purchased and installed by end user.

  * **Gas Fireplace**  

     * Fireplace insert -> Holds fireplace components.

        * Ignitor -> Ignites the fire with an electric spark.

        * Pilot light -> A small flame that stays lite, to help lite the burner.

        * Thermocouple -> Measures the temperature of the pilot light, to ensure constant operation. If the pilot goes out the Thermocouple will send a signal to the emergency shut off valve.

        * Emergency Shut Off Valve -> Shuts off the gas supply if the pilot light goes out.

        * Gas burner -> Location where the flames are generated by the burning gas.

        * Manual Gas Controls -> Used to control the flame volume on the fireplace burner unit.

 * Wireless Remote
