# **Pseudocode Project**

## Gas Fireplace

<br>

<p><img src = './img/fire.jpg' alt = 'Gas Fireplace' width = '150' /></p>

### **Operational Expectations**: The end-user will be able to turn the fireplace on or off at any desired time or set the unit to operate based on the desired room temperature. The fireplace controls are manual or remote via wireless remote control.

<br>

# **Important Items**

<br>

- If the pilot light goes out, a device must be installed to automatically shut off gas flow to protect the end user from harm.

- The thermostat must have a conversion option so the unit will work in multiple markets. (Fahrenheit / Celsius)

- A safe, high-temperature setting must be set so an end-user cannot accidentally set the temperature above the recommended temperature setting for the fireplace specifications.

- A manual igniter system to ensure the pilot light cannot be lit remotely, ensuring the fireplace has been inspected before the first use of the season.

  - Gas Line Object CONNECTS to Gas Burner Object with Gas Line Fitting.

    <br/><br/>

- ### **Manual Burner Gas valve**:

  - Purchased by end-user and installed by licensed professional. IManual Operation)

    - **FUNCTION**: CONTROLS the flow of gas from Gas line Object to Gas Burner Object.

      - IF end-user TURNS Manual Burner Gas valve to right

      - THEN gas WILL NOT flow.

      - IF end-user TURNS Manual Burner Gas valve to left

      - THEN gas WILL flow.

    <br/><br/>

- ### **Gas Fireplace Object**:

  - Main object containing sub-components working together to operate as one object.

  - #### **Fireplace Insert Object**:

    - A metal frame mounted inside a wall to safely house Gas Fireplace Object.

    <br/><br/>

  - ### **Control Unit Object**:

    - Three Way Switch Object:

      - CONNECTS to electric power.

      - **FUNCTION**: CONTROLS electric power to the Control Unit Object.

        - IF switch is set to OFF

        - THEN no electric power to Control Unit Object.

        - IF switch is set to REMOTE AND Wireless Remote Object On Button NOT CLICKED

        - THEN no electric power to Control Unit Object.

        - IF switch is set to REMOTE AND Wireless Remote Object On Button CLICKED

        - THEN electric power SENT to Control Unit Object.

        - IF switch set to ON

        - THEN electric power to Control Unit Object.

    - Remote Infrared/Bluetooth Sensor Object:

      - **FUNCTION**: RECEIVES wireless signals from the Wireless Remote Object to remotely ACCESS the Control Unit Object.

        - IF Remote Sensor HAS electric power (in case infrared add AND sensor is not COVERED)

        - THEN Remote Sensor can receive Wireless Remote signal

        - IF Remote Sensor DOES NOT HAVE electric power (in case of infrared add OR sensor is COVERED)

        - THEN Remote Sensor cannot receive Wireless Remote signal

    - **FUNCTION**: CONTROLS the volume of the flame produced by the Gas Burner Object.

      - Flame Control Knob Object provides a minimum and maximum amount the flame can be adjusted.

      - IF Flame Control Knob is LESS THAN 50%

      - THEN Gas Burner Object will produce flame LESS THAN 50% capacity.

      - IF Flame Control Knob is GREATER THAN 50% THEN

      - Gas Burner Object will produce flame GREATER THAN 50% capacity.

    - **FUNCTION**: CONTROLS the flow of gas from Gas Line Object to Gas Burner Object AND Pilot Light Object, by manually holding open the Electronic Controlled Gas Valve.

      - IF end-user PUSHES Flame Control Knob OPENING Electronic Controlled Gas Valve

      - THEN gas WILL flow to Pilot Light Object.
